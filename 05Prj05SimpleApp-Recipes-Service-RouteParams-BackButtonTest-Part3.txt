Copy prj04SimpleApp-Recipes-RoutingTest-Part2 and rename it as prj05SimpleApp-Recipes-ServiceTest-Part3
	run command "npm install"
	
run "ionic serve" to make sure that the app runs fine 

Create a recipes service inside recipes folder 
	> ionic generate service recipes/recipes
	
Remove the recipes array from the "recipes.page.ts" and add to the "recipes.service.ts". 
	Make it private. 
	Write two methods to pull the recipes. 
		getAllRecipes() ==> use ... spread operator to return the copy of the original array 
		getRecipe(recipeId: string) ==> return the single recipe, again the copy should return using the ... spread operator 
		
Add the recipesService to "recipes.page.ts" and using it pull the recipes. 

On the recipe-detail.page.ts we'll need to get the recipeId from the route and then pull from the service. 

While the app is running, go to the following two routes and the particular recipe should load. Check the port per the serve 
	http://localhost:8100/recipes/r1 
	http://localhost:8100/recipes/r2 
	

On the recipe-detail provide a back button. Check the following for more details 
	https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/back-button 
	IMPORTANT: provide the defaultHref="/recipes" so that there is back link availble when the user lands on the sub page directly.
