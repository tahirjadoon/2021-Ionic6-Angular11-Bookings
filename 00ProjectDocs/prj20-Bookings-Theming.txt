Copy "prj19Bookings-SegmentedButtons-Spinner-LoadingController-ActionSheetController" and rename it as "prj20Bookings-theming"
	run command "npm install"
	
run "ionic serve" to make sure that the app runs fine 

Theming: https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/basics
CSS Utililites: https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities 

app/theme folder has the files to update
	* variables.scss
	
	variables.scss will get modified so the ogiginal in the folder has been renamed to "variables-original-start.scss". 
	
app folder has the global.scss 


Step 1: changing the base color at once. 
	changing all the colors at once using the color generator
		https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/color-generator 
	Once satisfied with the colors, copy the :root and paste in the variables.scss file. 
	
Step 2: globally changing the toolbar backgroup and color 
	in the variables.css, add the following to the :root section towards the bottom 
		/*not passing the fallback color*/
		--ion-toolbar-background: var(--ion-color-primary);
		--ion-toolbar-color: var(--ion-color-primary-contrast);
		
	IMPORTANT: we can still apply a different color to the tool bar in the auth.page.html as well. 
	
	if face an issue with ios tool bar then add the following as well 
	
	ion-toolbar {
	  ion-button,
	  ion-back-button,
	  ion-menu-button,
	  .sc-ion-back-button-ios-h {
		--color: white;
	  }
	}

Step 3: custom css rules 
	3.1: Creating new component 
		Go to offers.page.html and move the ion-item to its own component. 
	
		This will be a regular angular component 
	
		The component name would tbe offer-item and it will go inside the offers folder
		
			> ionic generate component places/offers/offer-item 
			
			If the OfferItemComponent doesn't get added to the offer.module.ts then add it to the declarations array
				declarations: [OffersPage, OfferItemComponent]
		
		The offer will be passed into this component, check the "offer-item.component.ts" and "offer-item.component.html" for details 
		
		Also, the html has changed to style it better. Check it against the previous procject. 
		
	3.2: applying styles 
		open "offer-item.component.scss" and apply the styles
		
	3.3: component specific styles 
		This would need to be applied at the component level like following. If no color is applied to the button itself then this color will take affect. 
		
		ion-button{
			--background: blue;
		}
