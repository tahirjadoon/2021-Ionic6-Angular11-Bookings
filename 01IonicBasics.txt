ionic platform 
	web components => this is what you see on the screen 
		stencil: used by inic to build the web components.
	capacitor: web app to native mobile app 
	ionic cli: works with angular cli -- full build workflow 
	
Installing ionic 
	Go to https://ionicframework.com/
	then developers => installation 
	you must have node installed to install the ionic cli. My installation is 
		node: v14.15.5
		npm: 6.14.11
		angular: 11.2.0
		ionic: 6.13.1
	then install ionic issuing the following command

	if there are previous versions installed then uninstall thse first 
		npm uninstall -g ionic
		npm install -g @ionic/cli
	
To start an ionic app 
	https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/starting 
	ionic start myApp tabs
	ionic serve
	
Creating ionic project 
	> ionic start 
		this will ask a few questions 
		javascript framework: angular 
		projectName: baseProject 
		starterTemplate: blank 
		integrate app with capacitor: y
		
		The home component html has been changed slightly 
		
Run the app 
	> ionic serve 
	
Generating pages, modules etc 
	> ionic generate 
		page, component, service, module, class, directive, guard, pipe, interface, enum

	IMPORTANT: run this after every ng build
	
	Live reload 
	> ionic capacitor run android
	or 
	> ionic capacitor run android -l [live reload]
	or 
	> ionic capacitor run android -l --host=YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
	
	This will open the app in the android studio. Let it come up, the first run will take some time

	capacitor.config.json
		 "appId": "com.ionic.recipes",
		 
	>ng build 
	
	>ionic capacitor copy ios 
	
	>ionic capacitor run ios
		Build and copy steps are performed by the following and opens xcode as well. IOS folder will be selected as well in xcode
		
	>ionic capacitor run ios -l 
		Live reload - this wont run ng build, this will only run ng serve
